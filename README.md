# DataStructures-Cookies

Language and Libraties


ðŸ”¸C++ used as the Programming Language


ðŸ”¸list and vector libraries used for help


Tools


ðŸ’» Xcode was used for the development of the project

Goals


:dart:Implement the concepts of OOP like inheritance , polymorphism and and abstraction.


:dart:Implementation of LinkedList and Vector data structures.


Scenario

A basket has many cookies and user can customize the basket with the help of several functions enlisted below:


:heavy_check_mark: add cookie 


:heavy_check_mark: check if cookie is present in the basket or not


:heavy_check_mark: remove any cookie


:heavy_check_mark: remove a cookie with a specific type and size from the basket


:heavy_check_mark: make the basket empty


:heavy_check_mark: check if the basket is empty


:heavy_check_mark: return the total number of cookies in the basket


:heavy_check_mark: return the number of cookies of the same size in the basket


:heavy_check_mark: return the number of cookies of the same type in the basket


:heavy_check_mark: print the cookies in the basket arranged with respect to their size


:heavy_check_mark: merge two baskets


:heavy_check_mark: copy a basket


:heavy_check_mark: intersect two baskets


There will be two implementations of basket one using linked list structure and other one using vector data structure providing implementations of above functions.
